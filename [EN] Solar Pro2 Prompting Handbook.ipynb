    "\n",
    "solar-pro2 is a reasoning model optimized for high-performance inference and diverse task execution. This guide presents a systematic prompting methodology to help developers maximize the enhanced capabilities of solar-pro2. Since solar-pro2 is highly sensitive to clear and structured instructions, effective prompt design directly impacts performance. Along with existing general best practices, a prompt approach tailored to solar-pro2's characteristics is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "All examples in this guide consist of executable code that can be immediately tested and verified. Experience the performance by directly running the prompt examples in each section. Please follow these steps before running this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **API Key Issuance**: Sign up at [Upstage Console](https://console.upstage.ai/api-keys?api=chat) and obtain your API key\n",
    "2. **Environment Variable Setup**: Set the obtained API key as an environment variable or input it directly\n",
    "3. **Package Installation**: Install the required packages and complete the API setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Please be careful not to expose your API key externally!\n"
